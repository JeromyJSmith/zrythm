"Zrythm stores all of its configuration using the GSettings mechanism, "

"Normally, you shouldn't need to access any of these settings as most of "
"them are found inside Zrythm's UI, and it is not recommended to edit them"

"settings internally, but in some cases you may want to change them "
"manually for some reason - for example if your selected backend causes "
"Zrythm to crash."
