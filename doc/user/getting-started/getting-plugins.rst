Getting Plugins, Instruments and Samples
========================================

Plugins
-------

Zrythm ships with a few bundled plugins to help users
get started, but users are expected to download and
install their own plugins that suit their
preferences.

There are many plugins to choose from. This guide
will show you a few ways you can install plugins on
GNU/Linux systems.

.. note:: For other systems, you can find a `list of free
  software plugins here
  <https://github.com/webprofusion/OpenAudio>`_.

.. tip:: See :ref:`scanning-plugins` for paths where plugins
  will be scanned in.

For users of Debian-based distributions such as Ubuntu and
Linux Mint we recommend using
the `KXstudio repositories <https://kx.studio/>`_, as
there are many plugins that can easily be installed via apt.

For users of Arch Linux-based distributions such as
Manjaro we recommend installing the
`lv2-plugins <https://www.archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/lv2-plugins/>`_
group.
