System Requirements
===================

Hardware
--------
- x86_64 (64-bit), i686 (32-bit), armhf (ARMv7) or aarch64 (ARMv8)

Operating System
----------------
- GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Windows or MacOS

Recommendations
---------------

CPU
  For smooth operation, we recommend using a CPU
  with at least 2GHz clock speed and at least 4
  cores in total.
Monitor
  It is recommended to have at least 16 inches of
  monitor space to work efficiently with Zrythm.
Audio interface
  An audio interface offers low latency and better
  quality than integrated sound cards (especially if
  recording audio).
MIDI keyboard
  For quickly trying out melodies or recording.

JACK
----
When using the :term:`JACK` backend, JACK needs to
be set up
and configured before running Zrythm. You will find
lots of information online about how to configure
JACK, such as
`Demystifying JACK - A Beginners Guide to Getting Started with JACK <https://libremusicproduction.com/articles/demystifying-jack-%E2%80%93-beginners-guide-getting-started-jack.html>`_,
so we will skip this part.
