Control Room
============
The control room is used to edit global settings related
to mixing and routing signals.

Monitor Out
-----------
In Zrythm, what you actually hear through your speakers is
not the output of the master track, but the monitor
output.

The master track routes its output to a special processor
called `Monitor Out` that changes the volume before sending
the output to the speakers.
