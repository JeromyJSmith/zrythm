Recording
=========

Arming Tracks
-------------
Tracks can be armed for recording by clicking the
record button, either inside the track or inside its
fader section in the channel or
:ref:`track inspector <track-inspector>`.

   :align: center

When tracks are armed for recording, they start
listening for signals in their :ref:`track-inputs`
and these signals will be passed along in the
processing chain.

For example, if an instrument track is armed for
recording and it has a MIDI keyboard connected in
its inputs, you will hear sound when you press a
key on your MIDI keyboard.

Recording Audio & MIDI
----------------------
After arming the tracks you want to record events
into, enable recording in :ref:`transport-controls`
and press play. Any signals received will be
recorded inside new regions in the timeline.

Inputs
~~~~~~
Audio and MIDI/Instrument tracks have an
:ref:`tracks/inspector-page:Inputs`
section in their
:ref:`Inspector Page <tracks/inspector-page:Track Inspector>`
to adjust inputs for recording.

Recording Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clicking the arrow next to the record button will
bring up the recording settings where various options
and recording modes can be selected.

Options
+++++++
Punch in/out
  Whether to use punch in/out markers. When this
  is enabled, recording will start when the playhead
  reaches the punch in marker and stop when the
  playhead reaches the punch out marker.

Start on MIDI input
  Automatically start recording when an event is
  received from a MIDI device

Recording Modes
+++++++++++++++
Overwrite events
  Overwrite any existing events in the track during
  recording
Merge events
  Merge the newly recorded events with the existing
  events in the track
Create takes
  Create a new lane (`take`) for each new recording
Create takes (mute previous)
  Similar to `Create takes` but mutes the last
  recorded take before creating a new one

Recording Automation
--------------------
Automation can be recorded in `latch` mode or
`touch` mode. The mode can be selected and toggled
by clicking on it inside automation tracks.

Latch
~~~~~

.. image:: /_static/img/automation-latch.png
   :align: center

In latch mode, automation will be written constantly
and overwrite previous automation.

Touch
~~~~~

.. image:: /_static/img/automation-touch.png
   :align: center

In touch mode, automation will be written only when
there are changes. When changes stop being received
(after a short amount of time) automation will stop
being written until a change is received again.
This is useful for making minor changes to existing
automation.

.. note:: Unlike MIDI/audio recording, automation recording
  does not require `Record` to be enabled in the
  :ref:`transport-controls`.
