Theming
=======
Zrythm aims to allow extensive theming support. You can override
many defaults that Zrythm uses by placing things in your
Zrythm user directory. This directory can be found in the
:ref:`preferences` and will be referred to as
`the Zrythm directory` in this chapter.

The `Zrythm installation directory` refers to where
Zrythm was installed in. This is normally
:file:`/usr` on GNU/Linux,
:file:`C:\\Program Files\\Zrythm` on Windows and
:file:`Resources` under the the Application
contents on MacOS.
