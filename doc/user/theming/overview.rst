Theming
=======
Zrythm aims to allow extensive theming support. You
can override many defaults that Zrythm uses by
placing things in your Zrythm user directory. This
directory can be found in the :ref:`preferences`
and will be referred to as `the Zrythm directory`
in this chapter.

The `Zrythm installation directory` refers to where
Zrythm was installed in. This is normally
:file:`/usr` on GNU/Linux,
:file:`C:\\Program Files\\Zrythm` on Windows and
:file:`Resources` under the the Application
contents on MacOS.
