CSS
===
You can override the GTK theme that Zrythm uses along with
much of the color scheme in a special CSS file. It is
a good idea to start by copying the theme from your Zrythm
installation directory
(normally :file:`/usr/share/zrythm/themes/zrythm-theme.css` on
GNU/Linux and :file:`share/zrythm/themes/zrythm-theme.css` in
the installation path on Windows or the Application contents
on MacOS.

You should create a file called :file:`theme.css` under the
:file:`themes` directory in your Zrythm directory. For example,
if your Zrythm directory is :file:`/home/me/zrythm`, you should
create a file at :file:`/home/me/zrythm/themes/theme.css`.

.. note:: The Zrythm theme inherits from the
  `Matcha GTK theme <https://github.com/vinceliuice/Matcha-gtk-theme>`_, so additional CSS rules may need to be
  overridden.

Color Scheme
------------
Inside the theme file, you will find lots of colors defined
using ``@define-color``. You can override these with your
own colors and Zrythm will use them where possible.

Other GTK-Specific Rules
------------------------
You will find lots of information about changing CSS
rules for general GTK widgets online.
