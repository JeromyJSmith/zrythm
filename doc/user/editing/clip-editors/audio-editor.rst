Audio Functions
---------------

Audio functions are logic that can be applied
to transform the selected audio part.

The following functions are available.

Invert
  Invert the polarity of the audio.
Normalize Peak
  Normalize the audio so that its peak is 0dB.
Linear Fade In
  Fade the audio from silence to full amplitude.
Linear Fade Out
  Fade the audio from full amplitude to silence.
Nudge
  Shift the audio by 1 sample backward or forward.
Reverse
  Reverse the audio (play back backwards).
External Program
  Run an external program (such as
  `Audacity <https://www.audacityteam.org/>`_)
  to edit the audio.

     Edit the selected audio in an external app

  The selected program will be run with the path to
  a temporary file as an argument. Normally, the
  application will open that file, otherwise you will
  have to open it manually.

  .. hint:: You can select and copy the path in the
     dialog.

  Once you've made your changes to the file, close
  the external app and press OK. Zrythm will then
  apply your changes to the selected audio part.

  .. important:: The length of the audio must stay
     exactly the same, otherwise this operation will
     fail.
