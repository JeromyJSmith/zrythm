   Automation arranger

The automation arranger contains automation points
drawn as circles and curves connecting them. During
playback, Zrythm will interpolate the value of the
control being automated based on the curve.

Editing inside the automation arranger generally
follows :ref:`edit-tools` and
:ref:`common-operations`, with the
added feature that curves can be dragged up or down
to change their `curviness`.
