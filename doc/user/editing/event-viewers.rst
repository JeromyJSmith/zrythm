Event Viewers
=============

An event viewer (or `list editor`) displays all
events in the corresponding arranger as a list.

The event viewer can be shown by clicking the
:guilabel:`Toggle event viewer` button in the
corresponding arranger toolbar.

Sorting
-------

Columns in the header row can be clicked to sort
the events in ascending or descending order.

Editing
-------

Some values can be changed by clicking in the
corresponding field to enter edit mode, then
pressing :kbd:`Enter` when done.

Object Selection
----------------

The object selection in the event viewer is linked
to the arranger. This means that selecting objects
inside the event viewer will also select them inside
the arranger and vice-versa.
