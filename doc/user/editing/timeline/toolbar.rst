timeline-specific operations.

.. todo:: Update this section/pic.

   :align: center

It contains a snap section, a quantize section, and
an audio region section. For details about snapping
and quantization, see the previous pages.

Audio Region Section
--------------------

Musical Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~
When this is on, audio regions will be automatically
time-stretched to match the new BPM, each time the BPM
changes. If this is off, changing the BPM will cause
audio regions to be repeated accordingly to match the
new BPM without being time-stretched.
