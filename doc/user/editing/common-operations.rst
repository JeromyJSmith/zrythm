Common Operations
=================

These operations are common to most editors.

Undo/Redo
---------
Most actions in Zrythm are undoable, which means
that you can go back to the state before that
action was made, or you can come back to a state
that you undo'ed from.

For example, if you create a MIDI note and press
undo, the MIDI note will be deleted (Zrythm goes
back into the state where the MIDI note did not
exist). Pressing the :guilabel:`Redo` button will
create the note again, and you can go back between
:guilabel:`Undo` and :guilabel:`Redo` as many times
as you want.

It is also possible to go back/forth more than one
action, by clicking the arrow next to the
:guilabel:`Undo` and :guilabel:`Redo` buttons.

The shortcuts for undo and redo are
:kbd:`Control-z` and :kbd:`Control-Shift-z`.

.. warning:: If you Undo and then perform a new
   action, the Redo history will be deleted.
